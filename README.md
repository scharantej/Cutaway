 ## Problem Analysis

Building a video editing website involves creating a platform that allows users to upload, edit, and share videos. The website should provide users with a range of editing tools, such as trimming, cropping, adding effects, and adjusting audio levels. Additionally, the website should provide users with the ability to share their videos on social media platforms or download them to their devices.

## Design

The design for a Flask application to build a video editing website should include the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: This file will serve as the homepage of the website and will provide users with an overview of the features and capabilities of the website.
* `upload.html`: This file will allow users to upload videos to the website.
* `edit.html`: This file will allow users to edit their videos using the provided editing tools.
* `share.html`: This file will allow users to share their videos on social media platforms or download them to their devices.

The following routes should be included in the Flask application:

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file.
* `/upload`: This route will render the `upload.html` file.
* `/edit/<video_id>`: This route will render the `edit.html` file and pass in the video ID as a parameter.
* `/share/<video_id>`: This route will render the `share.html` file and pass in the video ID as a parameter.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Flask application will involve creating the HTML files and routes described above, as well as writing the necessary Python code to handle the user requests. The Python code will include functions to upload videos, edit videos, and share videos. The application will also need to be configured to handle user authentication and authorization.

## Testing

The Flask application should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is functioning properly. The testing process should include testing the following:

* The ability to upload videos
* The ability to edit videos
* The ability to share videos
* The ability to handle user authentication and authorization

The testing process should also include testing the application for security vulnerabilities.

## Deployment

The Flask application can be deployed to a production environment once it has been thoroughly tested. The deployment process will involve setting up a web server, configuring the web server to run the Flask application, and making the application accessible to users.
